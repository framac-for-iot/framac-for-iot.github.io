# Frama-C for the Internet of Things

[Frama-C](https://frama-c.com) is a framework for the static and dynamic analysis of ANSI-C programs. 
We explore the use of this framework for the formal verification of IoT software, in particular the [Contiki](http://www.contiki-os.org) lightweight operating system.

Our work include research work on the verification of Contiki and other IoT software, research work on extension of Frama-C to ease IoT verification, 
as well as tutorials on these topics.
